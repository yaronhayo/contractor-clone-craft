          question: "Is it safe to operate my garage door with a broken spring?",
          answer: "Absolutely not. With broken springs, your garage door weighs 300-500 pounds with no counterbalance assistance. Attempting to lift manually can cause severe back injury, and the door could fall unexpectedly, crushing feet or damaging vehicles. Disconnect the opener and avoid using the door until professional repair.",

Replacing both ensures balanced door operation, prevents a second service call, and costs only marginally more than single spring replacement.",

Cold New Jersey winters can reduce spring life slightly as metal becomes more brittle, making high-cycle springs especially valuable in our climate.",

        {
          question: "Can I replace garage door springs myself to save money?",

The Consumer Product Safety Commission reports 30,000+ DIY garage door injuries annually, with spring-related injuries being the most severe. Professional installation costs far less than emergency room bills.",

          answer: "Torsion springs (mounted above the door) are safer, last longer, and provide smoother operation. Extension springs (mounted alongside tracks) are less expensive but more dangerous - they can snap and fly across the garage. We recommend upgrading extension spring systems to torsion springs for improved safety and performance.",

          answer: "Most residential garage door installations are completed in 4-6 hours, including removal of the old door. Complex installations with custom sizing or electrical work may require a full day. We schedule installations to minimize disruption to your daily routine and always complete cleanup the same day.",

          answer: "Yes, we handle all necessary permits and ensure installation meets current New Jersey building codes. Our licensed contractor status allows us to pull permits efficiently. We schedule any required inspections and ensure full compliance with local regulations.",

          answer: "We install traditional raised panel, carriage house, contemporary, and modern architectural styles. Materials include steel (most popular), wood, aluminum, and composite. Insulation options range from non-insulated to R-18.4. We'll help you select the best combination for your home's architecture and budget.",

          question: "Is professional installation really necessary for garage doors?",
          answer: "Absolutely. Garage doors weigh 200-500 pounds and involve high-tension springs, electrical connections, and precise adjustments. Professional installation ensures safety, optimal performance, and maintains manufacturer warranties. DIY installation voids most warranties and creates significant safety risks.",
          category: "Professional Installation"
        },
        {
          question: "How do insulated garage doors save energy costs?",
          answer: "Insulated doors reduce heat transfer between your garage and home by up to 20%. For attached garages, this significantly reduces heating and cooling costs. Insulation also reduces noise transmission and strengthens the door structure. In New Jersey's climate, insulated doors typically pay for themselves within 3-5 years.",

        },
        {
          question: "What warranty coverage comes with new garage door installation?",

We provide full warranty documentation and handle any warranty claims directly with manufacturers. Extended warranty options available for additional coverage.",
